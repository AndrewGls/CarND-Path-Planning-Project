# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
In this project, the goal is to design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic. A successful path planner will be able to keep inside its lane, avoid hitting other cars, and pass slower moving traffic all by using localization, sensor fusion, and map data.
